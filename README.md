# Natural Language Processing with Dramas
Since I liked watching dramas and often read reviews / blogs for the latest trending drama, I thought it would be interesting to do an NLP project related to it. I have since adapted people's codes and applied them in two projects:

- Drama reviews sentiment analysis (Nov-Dec 2019)
  - Skills picked up include:
    - Web scraping (data collection)
    - Exploratory data analysis (data preprocessing + data visualisation)
    - Sentiment analysis using sklearn

- Drama recommender system (Jan 2020)
  - Skills picked up include:
    - Simple, content-based & collaborative filtering recommender systems using sckit-learn
    - Collaborative filtering using fast.ai
