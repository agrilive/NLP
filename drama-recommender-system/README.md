# Drama Recommender Systems

I often use the filter function to find dramas to watch, or rely on the 'Recommendations' tab on the website https://mydramalist.com/shows/top, where viewers suggest similar dramas based on plot/characters etc.

There is definitely a smarter system, just like how YouTube recommends videos to us. I read up a few articles on building recommender systems and tried my own project. The process was similar to the drama reviews project:

1. Web scrape for drama data
2. Combine data
3. Exploratory data analysis - Data visalization
4. Recommender systems using machine learning - Scikit-learn
5. Recommender systems using deep learning - fast.ai
