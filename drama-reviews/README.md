# Drama Reviews
I love watching dramas, and often look up this website 'https://mydramalist.com/shows/top' to find top dramas to watch. With some new Python skills that I have picked up, I wanted to do something related to dramas such as:

1. Web scrape the drama reviews
2. Preprocess the drama reviews
3. Conduct exploratory data analysis on the reviews - Data Visualization
4. Identify topics present in the reviews - Topic Modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
5. Uncover the sentiment of viewers - Sentiment Analysis using sklearn
